			<h1>CU Boulder: Reports of "active harmer" believed to be hoax</h1>
			<p>BOULDER, Colo. -- CU Boulder issued a second campus safety alert warning on Wednesday -- this time about  "unconfirmed reports" of an "active harmer." Authorities later called the reports a hoax. The situation unfolded temporarily in the University Memorial Center (UMC) area, authorities said, before announcing it likely was a hoax.  The building was evacuated shortly after 1:05 p.m. after police said there was a false report of an active shooter. But 30 minutes later, students and staff were told to take "appropriate protective action." The second report also turned out to be a hoax. CU said around 2:45 p.m. that the UMC and Champions Center would be closed the rest of the day, though classes and campus operations would continue as normal.</p>
